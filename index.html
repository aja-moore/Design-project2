                <td>Hi, my name is Aja Moore and i do not have much experience with coding thought I do a bit in
                    grade 7. I will use Visual Studio code to create my website. This app will help me by letting me
                    visualize my code on the live server. I have decided to make a website about the basics of
                    sailing.This topic interests me because I enjoy sailing and thought it would be a fun topic to
                    write about. The website will be designed for people who want to learn more about sailing. The
                    end-user will get access to the page by google or by the website being shared with them. The
                    final goal of my web page is to teach others about the basics of sailing. I will know that I meet
                    this goal by putting a survey on the website and collecting the data. I researched about color,
                    typography,layout and images. These topics will help me make a website that is easy to
                    navigate and has good information. A few limitations I feel I will encounter is making the
                    information accurate without making it to long to read. As well, I think that it will be challenging
                    for me to make a good layout that is easy to understand and navigate. I expect my website to
                    have lots of information in different subcategories of the basics of sailing.<br></td>
